### When PA is in user mode: define the runtime path for the 'pactl' command to use.  Substitute the correct uid in the path.
#export PULSE_RUNTIME_PATH=/var/run/user/1000/pulse

#sleep 0.5

echo $(date) [done.sh] ...Playing finish beep
paplay --property=media.role=notification /home/pi/custom-sounds/done.wav 
sleep 1

### Here we will end the audio ducking we invoked at teh awake.sh stage
### this will search the list of clients on the PA server for the 'silence' stream we initiated and kill it.  This will take the PA server out of ducking mode and your music will return to normal volume
echo $(date) [done.sh] ...Killing 'silence' pulseaudio client
sudo kill $(pactl list clients | awk '/application.name = "silence"/,/^$/' | awk -F' = ' '/application.process.id/ {print $2}' | sed 's/"//g')

### Insert any commands that you would like to call for performing external actions.

#echo $(date) [done.sh] ...Sending mute to living room tv 
#curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"remote":"remote.living_room_hub","device":"JBL Sound Bar","command":"Mute"}' https://<HA server address>:8123/api/webhook/<WEBHOOK>  > /dev/null 2>&1
